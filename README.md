# Hello-world
Just a first repositor
Hello world, I am a high school English teacher currently exploring the wild and wacky world of private school education system in China. I am interested in learning how to read and write code for a variety of reason: I would like to develop it as a hobby, I think it will give me a new skill-set to sove problems at work, and I hope that it will improve my career prospects as I return to university or work back in my home-country. Nice to meet you world.
