# Hello-world
Just a first repository.

Hello world, 

I am a high school English teacher currently exploring the wild and wacky world of private school education system in China. I am interested in learning how to read and write code for a variety of reason: I would like to develop it as a hobby, I think it will give me a new skill-set to sove problems at work, and I hope that it will improve my career prospects as I return to university or work back in my home-country. 

Nice to meet you world. 


So this is my second atttempt at creating a branch and a pull request. I am still not sure how either of them work. Lets see if we can get there.
